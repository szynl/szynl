## <picture><img src = "./assets/cat.gif" width = 50px></picture> About me

<br>

- I'm Serena, a prepenultimate computer science student at the University of Sydney. I love music, marine biology and all things mathematical!

- Although I only started programming in February, I've already developed a pretty solid understanding of Python and R for data science. I've also managed to dabble in a bit of C++ for game development during this time, but right now I'm mainly learning Java.

- You can contact me at <a href="mailto:serenazhuoyanli@protonmail.com">serenazhuoyanli@protonmail.com or come say hi to me on Discord. I'm always looking to contribute to various projects and collaborate with others!
