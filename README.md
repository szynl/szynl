### About me 👋
I'm Serena, a penultimate year Bachelor of Computing student at the University of Sydney. I love all things hardware related and I'll be interning at a semiconductor company this summer. Currently working on some FPGA projects, trying to 100% Elden Ring and going on lots of bushwalks in my spare time!
