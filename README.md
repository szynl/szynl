## <picture><img src = "./assets/cat.gif" width = 50px></picture> About me

<br>

- I'm Serena, a penultimate computer science student at the University of Sydney. I love music, marine biology and all things mathematical!

- Although I only started programming last year, I've already developed a pretty solid understanding of Python and R for data science, as well as Java and C++ for application and systems programming. When I have more time on my hands, I'll definitely be studying for some cybersecurity certifications and building more sophisticated projects!

- You can contact me at <a href="mailto:serenazhuoyanli@protonmail.com">serenazhuoyanli@protonmail.com or come say hi to me on Discord. I'm always looking to contribute to various projects and collaborate with others!
