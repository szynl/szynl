### About me 👋
I'm Serena, a final year Bachelor of Computing student at the University of Sydney. I love all things hardware related and I'm currently interning at a semiconductor company this summer in their Graphics team. I'm also a big fan of epic fantasy, RPGs, medieval architecture and hiking in my spare time.
